## Source

### Source: CSV

One line per device, colon seperated. If `ip` isn't present, a DNS lookup will be done against `name`.  For large installations, setting `ip` will dramatically reduce startup time.

```
source:
  default: csv
  csv:
    file: /var/lib/oxidized/router.db
    delimiter: !ruby/regexp /:/
    map:
      name: 0
      ip: 1
      model: 2
      username: 3
      password: 4
    vars_map:
      enable: 5
```

Example csv `/var/lib/oxidized/router.db`:

```
rtr01.local:192.168.1.1:ios:oxidized:5uP3R53cR3T:T0p53cR3t
```

If you would like to use a GPG encrypted file as the source then you can use the following example:

```yaml
source:
  default: csv
  csv:
    file: ~/.config/oxidized/router.db
    delimiter: !ruby/regexp /:/
    gpg: true
    gpg_password: 'password'
    map:
      name: 0
      model: 1
```

> Please note, if you are running GPG v2 then you will be prompted for your gpg password on start up, if you use GPG >= 2.1 then you can add the following config to stop that behaviour:

> Within `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`

> `allow-loopback-pinentry`

> and within: `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`

> `pinentry-mode loopback`

### Source: SQL
 Oxidized uses the `sequel` ruby gem. You can use a variety of databases that aren't explicitly listed. For more information visit https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel Make sure you have the correct adapter!
### Source: MYSQL

`sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev`

The values correspond to your fields in the DB such that ip, model, etc are field names in the DB

```
source:
  default: sql
  sql:
    adapter: mysql2
    database: oxidized
    table: nodes
    user: root
    password: rootpass
    map:
      name: ip
      model: model
      username: username
      password: password
    vars_map:
      enable: enable
```

### Source: SQLite

One row per device, filtered by hostname.

```
source:
  default: sql
  sql:
    adapter: sqlite
    database: "/var/lib/oxidized/nodes.db"
    table: nodes
    map:
      name: fqdn
      model: model
      username: username
      password: password
    vars_map:
      enable: enable
```

### Custom SQL Query Support

You may also implement a custom SQL query to retreive the nodelist using  SQL syntax with the `query:` configuration parameter under the `sql:` stanza.


#### Custom SQL Query Examples

You may have a table named `nodes` which contains a boolean to indicate if the nodes should be enabled (fetched via oxidized). This can be used in the custom SQL query to avoid fetching from known impacted nodes.

In your configuration, you would add the `query:` parameter and specify the SQL query. Make sure to put this within the `sql:` configuration section.

```sql
query: "SELECT * FROM nodes WHERE enabled = True"
```

Since this is an SQL query, you can also provide a more advanced query to assist in more complicated oxidized deployments. The exact deployment is up to you on how you design your database and oxidized fetchers.

In this example we limit the nodes to two "POPs" of `mypop1` and `mypop2`. We also require the nodes to have the `enabled` boolean set to `True`.

```sql
query: "SELECT * FROM nodes WHERE pop IN ('mypop1','mypop2') AND enabled = True"
```
The order of the nodes returned will influence the order that nodes are fetched by oxidized. You can use standard SQL `ORDER BY` clauses to influence the node order.

You should always test your SQL query before using it in the oxidized configuration as there is no syntax or error checking performed before sending it to the database engine.

Consult your database documentation for more information on query language and table optimization.



### Source: HTTP

One object per device.

HTTP Supports basic auth, configure the user and pass you want to use under the http: section.

```
source:
  default: http
  http:
    url: https://url/api
    scheme: https
    delimiter: !ruby/regexp /:/
    user: username
    pass: password
    map:
      name: hostname
      model: os
      username: username
      password: password
    vars_map:
      enable: enable
    headers:
      X-Auth-Token: 'somerandomstring'
```

You can also pass `secure: false` if you want to disable ssl certificate verification:

```
source:
  default: http
  http:
    url: https://url/api
    scheme: https
    secure: false
```
