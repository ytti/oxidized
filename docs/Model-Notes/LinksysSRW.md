# LinksysSRW model notes

This is a switch model with a horible IE5 only web interface that is unusable in any modern browser due to broken and buggy html and javascript.

On a first glance the serial or telnet interface isn't any more usable, but there is a way to break out of the menu driven interface and start a more usable cli.

This is what this model does and dumps the config in there.

As far as I know, the Linksys SRW 2008, SRW2016 , SRW2024 and SRW2048 are the only switches running this os/ui, but there might be others out there.

Over snmp they identifes them self as Operating System: Cisco Small Business Software, so that might be a clue to look for if you're trying to figure out if your switch could have this hidden cli.

The author of this model isn't the one who found this "hidden" cli but only someone who integrated it with oxidized. The real credits goes out to some unknown hero out there on the internet who figured this out a long time ago.
