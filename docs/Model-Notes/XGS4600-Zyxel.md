# ZynOS Configuration

## FTP

FTP access is only possible as admin, other users can login but cannot pull the files.
For the XGS4600 series the config file is _config_ and not _config-0_

The following line in _oxidized/lib/oxidized/model/zynos.rb_ will need changing

```text
  cmd 'config-0'
```

The inclusion of an extra ftp option is also require. Within _input_ add the following

```yaml
input:
  ftp:
    passive: false
```

## SSH/TelNet

Below is the table from the XGS4600 CLI Reference Guide (Version 3.79~4.50 Edition 1, 07/2017)
Take this table with a pinch of salt, level 3 will not allow _show running-config_!

Privilege Level | Types of commands at this privilege level
----------------|-------------------------------------------
0|Display basic system information.
3|Display configuration or status.
13|Configure features except for login accounts, SNMP user accounts, the authentication method sequence and authorization settings, multiple logins, administrator and enable passwords, and configuration information display.
14|Configure login accounts, SNMP user accounts, the authentication method sequence and authorization settings, multiple logins, and administrator and enable passwords, and display configuration information.

Oxidized can now retrieve your configuration!
